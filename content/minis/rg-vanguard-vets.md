They were primed with Corax White spray for all the white pieces and Chaos Black spray
for all the rest, and painted with the following paints from Citadel

- Eshin Grey
- Nuln Oil
- Dawnstone
- Celestra Grey
- Leadbelcher
- Khorne Red
- Evil Sunz Scarlet
- Warp Lightning
- Warplock Bronze
- Skeleton Horde
- Ulthuan Grey

The bases are done in the same style as all my other Raven Guard: Astrogranite with
a dry brush of Celestra Grey.
