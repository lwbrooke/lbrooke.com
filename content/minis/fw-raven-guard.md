Five more marines to fill out my first squad of ten MK VI Tactical marines!
Assembled from the Forge World [MkVI Corvus Armour](https://www.forgeworld.co.uk/en-US/Legion-MkVI-Corvus-Armour-2016).
This was a project of a couple firsts. This was the first time I drilled out the
barrels of the boltguns, and I am happy with how that process went. The other first
was that applying transfers, and I am quite happy with how they add to the models.
I did however use Lahmian Medium over the top to seal them down, and it
dried a bit chalky, so I'm going to use something else in the future.

They were primed with Chaos Black spray, and painted with the following paints from Citadel

- Eshin Grey
- Nuln Oil
- Dawnstone
- Celestra Grey
- Leadbelcher
- Khorne Red
- Evil Sunz Scarlet
- Warp Lightning
- Warplock Bronze

The bases are done in the same style as all my other Raven Guard: Astrogranite with
a dry brush of Celestra Grey.

Here are a couple more angles
