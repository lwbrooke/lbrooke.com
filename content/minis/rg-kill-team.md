The Raven Guard kill team is complete! The big theme around this team is bringing some big
guns to bring down hard targets. Those you can see in the lascannon and missile launcher. From
left to right we have; a vanguard vet sergeant with relic blade and stormshield, a tactical
marine gunner with a grav gun, a sternguard veteran gunner with lascannon, a tactical sergeant
with boltgun and an auspex, two regular tactical marines, and finally a tactical marine gunner
with a missile launcher.

I didn't have any transfers or sculpted shoulder pads, so I bought some 3d printed symbols
off of shapeways, and superglued them on. A couple turned out ok, but for several, the superglue
seeped up through the seams in the symbol and obscured a lot of the detail. I will probably be
looking for another solution in the future if I decide to make more.

They were primed with Corax White spray for all the white pieces and Chaos Black spray
for all the rest, and painted with the following paints from Citadel

- Eshin Grey
- Nuln Oil
- Dawnstone
- Celestra Grey
- Leadbelcher
- Khorne Red
- Evil Sunz Scarlet
- Warp Lightning
- Warplock Bronze
- Skeleton Horde
- Wyldwood
- Guilliman Blue Glaze
- Ulthuan Grey

The bases are Astrogranite with a dry brush of Celestra Grey.
