My name is Logan Brooke and I am currently a Software Engineer at the Bellevue office of [OpenMail](http://www.openmail.com/).

I maintain this website to put forth a professional web presence,
as well as a using it as a test bed for learning new web-technologies.

You will be able to find out more about me by navigating around the site, though currently information is a bit sparse.
There are links to [contact]({filename}/pages/contact.md) information, as well as an online [resume]({filename}/pages/resume.md).
In the future, I plan on adding sections for my personal projects, and perhaps a blog.
