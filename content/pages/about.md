Title: About

 My name is Logan Brooke and I am recent graduate of the Computer Science department at Eastern Washington University.
 I am currently working in a contracted, part-time position doing mobile software development, 
 and am looking for a permanent position as a Software Development Engineer.

 This website was originally a project for a class, but I elected to maintain it as a way to have a professional web presence. In the navigation menu, you will find my personal projects, online resume, and contact information. I am currently developing the site as time allows, and have taken it upon myself to learn the Bootstrap framework in order to expand my knowledge. I am working on updating the site, and I will continue to update as new projects come in.
