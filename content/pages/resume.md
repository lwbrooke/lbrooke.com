# Work Experience
## Independent Contractor
### February 2015 to April 2015
I am the primary mobile developer on this project, of which my portion handles communication between an Android Appcelerator app and an Arduino device via Bluetooth. In addition, the JavaScript based app uploads the events gathered by the Arduino device to an AWS database via a Node.js REST API. I further demonstrated problem solving skills by resolving several issues with prior iterations of the Arduino code.

# Personal Projects
## Mobile Bartender App for Windows Phone
Originally the final project for a class on C# and .NET; I have since continued this project on my own time to have it published in the Windows Phone App Store. The idea behind the app is that a user will select the ingredients that they have on hand and the app will generate three lists of drinks, depending on what ingredients are available.

## lbrooke.com
An extension of a website I had to maintain for school, I am in the process of extending it to be a permanent web presence for myself. The original classwork will remain while I continue to add sections for my own personal projects, which will vary from web-based to descriptions of more traditional projects. It has been developed with ASP.NET and the associated languages it needs to function. I will be adding new content as I have the time and ideas.

# School Projects
## Cork District Senior Project
The purpose of this project was to create a web based service for the purchase and use of redeemable wine tasting cards. There were three other group members, along with a real-world client, who we met with on a regular basis. We had a weekly sprint cycle, where we met with our professor to discuss the project. My responsibilities were website functionalities, database design, and progress reports. Customers can purchase cards on their own via a credit card, processed by Stripe, as well as at the winery via credit card or cash. The wineries had access to the portion of the site that allowed for redeeming uses on the cards and on site purchasing. Administrators had access to these features, as well as administrative tasks such as usage reports, manipulating users, and creating new runs of cards.

## Command Line Chat Program
This program had two parts, a server and client programs. The server managed four different chat rooms, each having a limit of 3 users per room as well as a waiting list. The client connected by running the program in a Unix terminal with the IP address of the server and the desired chat room as command line arguments. They would be informed of their status in the waiting list if one existed, and could send messages freely once in a room.

## Command Line Parser
This is the programming portion of the software engineering course which I took. The purpose was to simulate and condense a real-world software engineering project. We worked in teams of three people, with the main goals being parsing an incoming command and sending it to the appropriate handler, both within our own code and in a much larger, provided, codebase as necessary. The number of commands to deal with was divided amongst the team as evenly as possible, and we each had to contribute to the team progress report. We worked in ten day sprint cycles, with the progress reports at the end of each cycle.

## Linux Shell
This project was to write a Linux terminal shell that functioned on a similar level to the standard bash shell. It could accept simple commands, along with up to two piped commands, stored the history of used commands, as well the ability to change directories.

## Mobile Bartender for iOS
This app functions on the principle that the user has ingredients to make drinks and can then use the app to look up what drinks they can make. The user is presented with a list of ingredients, divided by category, where they select those that they have on hand. After tapping the search button they are presented with another list of drinks that can be made with the ingredients they have selected. A drink may be selected to view more detailed information on ingredients, instructions, descriptions, etc. Drinks can be favorited from this view, and a list of favorite drinks can be found from the ingredient selection view. There are tabs along the bottom that allow for the addition of more drinks and ingredients if the user was unable to find them.

## Pinball Machine
This project entailed creating the full logic for a classic pinball arcade machine. The machine had been retrofitted with an Arduino Mega 2560. I worked with one other person on this project, and while there was no clear division of labor, the both of us were present and contributing at all times when working on the project. We were supplied with a C++ library to ease the usage of the physical components of the machine, though we had done this by hand in previous projects. Other than in using the provided library, we were instructed to write C style code. The program could accept up to 4 players, with 3 balls each. Lights would indicate the ball number, current player, current bonuses, and current score. At the end, the high score would be displayed, and kept until the machine was turned off.
